Favicons can be set for both individual pages and the entire site with the `favicon_url` option. For example, this page has frontmatter,
```
---
layout: post
title: Custom Site Favicon
favicon_url: assets/img/favicon-alternate.svg
---
```

Favicons can also be selected by including `favicon_url` in `_config.yml`.

If you want to specify the full URL to a favicon, you can use `favicon_url_absolute` instead of `favicon_url`.
