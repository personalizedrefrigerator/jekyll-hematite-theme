title: Example Calendar
layout: calendar

# Include posts in the calendar

# Get date info from `h1` headers. This is the default,

calendar_date_elem: h1

This is a sample calendar. [View its source on GitHub](https://github.com/personalizedrefrigerator/jekyll-hematite-theme/blob/236e8d0e5b338db137f7ff52dd6b91fe76045b08/example/calendar.md).

Its frontmatter looks like this:
```
---
title: Example Calendar
layout: calendar

# Show posts in the calendar on the days associated
# with them.
include_posts: true

# Get date info from `h1` headers. This is the default,
# so in this case, `calendar_date_elem` could be omitted.
calendar_date_elem: h1
---
```

By choosing `h1` as the `calendar_date_elem`, we choose to
use toplevel headings to specify dates (`# Toplevel heading`).

List items following the header are associated with it
and added to the calendar.
